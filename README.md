# Implement EMA Java Application with Kotlin 

## Overview

This example project shows how to implement the Elektron Message API Java application with Kotlin. The console applications source code are implemented in Kotlin programming language. All source code will be compiled to Java classes which compatible with Java virtual machine. The applications will run with these Java classes files.
